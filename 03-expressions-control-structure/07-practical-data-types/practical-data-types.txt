Practical Data Types
--------------------
- PHP function "var_dump()"
    - Dumps information about a variable
        - Data type
        - Length of the value (if it is a string)
        - Value

    - It accepts multiple arguments
        - Each separated by a comma
        - Argument could be an expression, a value or variable

    - Reference (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php)

Syntax:

var_dump(<arg_1>, <arg_2>, ..., <arg_n>);
var_dump(<arg_1>, <expression>);


- In PHP, a non-zero (positive or negative) integer value
    - ALWAYS evaluates to a boolean "true"


- In PHP, a strict equality operator "==="
    - First checks between two values if they have IDENTICAL data type
        - Only then checks if their values are IDENTICAL

    - NO type coercion occurs that will
        - Evaluate an expression to become true


- In PHP, an indexed array
    - Has its 1st element (ALWAYS) located at index 0

    - Accessing a specific element in an array
        - Enclose its index key within a pair of [ ]
        - e.g. array[0]

    - Type coercion with array element
        - Follows a precedence of data type used in evaluating an expression
            - Float (high precedence)
            - Integer
            - String (low precedence)

    - An array can be Type casted into a specific data type
        - Declares the data type witin a pair of ( )
        - Prefixing the element
        - e.g. $scores = [85, (int) "90"];
