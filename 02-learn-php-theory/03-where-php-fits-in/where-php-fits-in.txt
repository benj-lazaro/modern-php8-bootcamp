Where Does PHP Fit In 
---------------------
- PHP interpreter alone is NOT enough to create a dynamic website
    - The following is a high-level overview where PHP comes into play
    - What are the other things required to have a working website  


- A "client" is a person using a web browser 
    - To access a website or server application


- A "web server" software (e.g. Apache, Nginx, etc.)
    - Hosts a website or server application

    - Accepts requests from a client
        - Sends back a response to the corresponding request to the client

    - Passes PHP code to the interpreter via "FastCGI" module
        - Simply a protocol that web servers use
            - To communicate with external programs e.g. PHP interpreter


- A "PHP FPM "(PHP FastCGI Process Manager)
    - It is an implementation of the "FastCGI" protocol for PHP
        
    - Manages processes, individually referred as "Worker Process" that
        - Can do something with the PHP code

    - When the web server forwards the request to the PHP FPM
        - One of the "Worker Process" forwards the PHP code to the PHP interpreter
        - Retrieves the output returned by the PHP interpreter
    

- PHP interpreter receives the PHP code, utilitizes the following & then returns the output
    - Tokenizer
        - Breaks down PHP code into tokens

    - Parser
        - Creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
        - Tree representation of the code flow

    - Compiler
        - Generates opcodes

        - If available, uses an "OpCache" that keeps
            - Compiled opcodes between subsequent requests inside the OpCache
    
    - Executor (Zend Engine)
        - Executes the generated opcodes

        - Interacts with external processes or programs
            - e.g. fetch data from the database software
            - e.g. work with the filesystem
            - e.g. extended functionalities via PHP extensions
    
        - PHP extensions
            - Created by the PHP community
                - Typically written in the C-language
            
            - Idea is to ensures that PHP at runtime is kept pure
                - Any need for PHP to work with an external technology
                - Then this functionality is written as an extension

            - By default, PHP is shipped with a set of popular extensions
